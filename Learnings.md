### Components

- Home
- Note

### Libraries

- Material UI

  - With Material UI , we need icons package that we need to install manually : Material Icons
  - npm i @mui/icons-material

- uuid package - for unique id

### Hooks

- UseRef : Basically in simple terms we say it works similar to document.querySelector and we can manipulte that element.We cannot use that directly in react since we do not have DOM , we have Virtual DOM.

### ContextAPI

So we need Notes at lot of places , so instead of getting stuck in that we will use ContextAPI - kind of global Storage

### Controlled Components
